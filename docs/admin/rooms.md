# Rooms

> Work in progress

The notion of a Room is central to SaaS Video Streaming Resell Platform. Intuitively, a Room represents a virtual space where end-users communicate. Technically, a Room is a computing resource that provides Real-time Communications (RTC) services to client applications through a set of APIs. A Room is a container for a set of Participants, and each Participant is a client application that connects to a Room. A Room is a resource that can be created, read, updated, and deleted. A Room is identified by a unique id, and each Room has a set of properties that can be configured.
