## Overview

Accounts are the second-level entities in the system. Accounts represent a specific service, like a video streaming service or web meeting service.

Accounts are associated with a single customer, and this customer has all privileges over the account. Accounts can have multiple users associated with them. Each account can have only one owner defined and as default the owner is user who was created with the account or first associated upon creation.
