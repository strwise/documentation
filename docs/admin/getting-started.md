## Administration Area

### Top Navigation Bar

The top navigation bar allows access to all platform features through a series of menus:

**Menus for each main area of platform.**

- **Home** - The Home menu contains links to the platform's dashboard and documentation.
- **Customers** - The Customers menu contains links to the platform's customers management features.
- **Accounts** - The Accounts menu contains links to the platform's accounts management features.
- **Rooms** - The Rooms menu contains links to the platform's rooms management features.

### Sidebar Navigation

The sidebar navigation menu displays links and information that relate to the current interface. The sidebar navigation menu is context-sensitive, meaning that the links and information displayed will change depending on the interface you are currently viewing.

For example, when you go to `Configuration () > Manage Admins`, the sidebar menu displays links to all the other system setting-related pages. If you navigate to the list of customers at Customers > List All Customers, the sidebar menu will include items from the Customers menu instead.

### Dashboard

The Administration Dashboard is the portal that admins access when they work within PaaS Video Streaming Resell Platform. The PaaS Video Streaming Resell Platform Administration Dashboard has interfaces and feature pages, each often containing multiple sub-interfaces.

The Admin Dashboard displays individual widgets. Each admin can arrange, maximise, or minimize these widgets and enable or disable them entirely for different administrator roles.
