# Overview

## Introduction

This section covering the basics of user main resources, logging in, and navigating the platform's resources.

A **User** is considered any authenticated user without any type of privileges. Users can be attached with specific privileges to entities such as [Customers](/docs/getting-started#customers), [Accounts](/docs/getting-started#accounts) and [Rooms](/docs/getting-started#rooms).

Users can exist regardless of the existence of any of the above entities. However, a user must be associated with at least one type of entity to be able to perform any action on the platform. Users without any association will be able to access the platform but will not be able to perform any action on it.
