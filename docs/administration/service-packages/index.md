# Overview

> Service Package describe the specific goods or services you offer to your customers.

A Service Package defines the service that a customer can subscribe and the resources that will be available. It can be a video streaming service, a web meeting service, or any other service that you want to offer to your customers.

Service Packages are composed of:

- **Provider**: The service that will be provided to the customer. It can be a video streaming service, a web meeting service, or any other service that you want to offer to your customers. See [Service Providers](/docs/service-providers).
- **Features**: The features that are available to the customer when they subscribe to the service.
- **Quotas**: The quotas that are available to the customer when they subscribe to the service.

You can create multiple Service Packages with different features and quotas that will be available for subscription by your customers. For example, you might offer a Standard and Premium package, with different features and quotas.
