Subscriptions are the business model that defines the service that the customer will have access to. Subscriptions are associated with a service package and are the subscriptions that are available to the customer when they subscribe to a service.

Through subscriptions, you can define the service name, description, and the service provider that will be used to provide the service. You can also define the subscription features and quotas that will be available when a customer subscribe to the service.
