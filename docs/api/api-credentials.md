> Work in progress

## Creating API Credentials

The platform uses API credentials to authenticate requests to the API. To create API credentials, navigate to the **API Credentials** page and click the **Create API Credentials** button. This will prompt you to enter the following information:

- **Name** - The name of the API credentials.
- **Description** - The description of the API credentials.
- **Permissions** - The permissions of the API credentials.
- **Expiration Date** - The expiration date of the API credentials.

Once you've entered the required information, the API credentials will be created, and you'll be able to use them to authenticate requests to the API.
