# API Overview

The API is a RESTful API that uses JSON for serialization and OAuth 2.0 for authentication. In this section, you will find information about the API resources and how to use them.

## Private API Reference

The private API reference to have all the API resources that are available on an administration level. This API reference is not intended to be used by the public (customers or users) and your access needs to be restricted.

All deployment will have a private API reference that can be accessed at `https://<api-endpoint>/private/`.

We keep an updated private API reference at https://video-stream-platform-api-reference.pages.dev/private/

## Public API Reference

The public API reference to have all the API resources that are available on a customer or user level. This API reference is intended to be used by the public (customers or users) and your access needs to be public.

All deployment will have a public API reference that can be accessed at `https://<api-endpoint>/public/`.

We keep an updated public API reference can be found at https://video-stream-platform-api-reference.pages.dev/public/

To conveniently test the API, we have created a Postman collection that contains all the API resources. The collection can be found at:
