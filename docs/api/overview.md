# API Overview

The API is a RESTful API that uses JSON for serialization and OAuth 2.0 for authentication. In this section, you will find information about the API resources and how to use them.

## Postman Collection

To conveniently test the API, we have created a Postman collection that contains all the API resources. The collection can be found at:
