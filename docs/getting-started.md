## Introduction

Welcome to the PaaS Video Streaming Resell Platform! This section will help you get started with the platform by covering the basics of administration, logging in, and navigating the platform's resources.

Once you've entered the required information, the administration account will be created and you'll be able to log in to the platform.

## Logging In to the Platform

### Dashboard

To log in to the platform, simply navigate to the login page and enter your administration account credentials. Once you've logged in, you'll be taken to the administration dashboard.
