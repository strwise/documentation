# User

## Overview

In StreamWise platform, users can own client accounts. This allows one user to manage products and services, billing, and other functions for multiple client accounts using a single login. 

## Invitations

To connect a user to multiple customers/accounts at any time, send invitations from each account to that user or email address. The invitee will receive an email and must click the included link.

Customers and accounts owners can send invitations from the User Management section of the Client Area.

* If you send an invitation to an email address for an existing account, they can access the client account using their existing login credentials.
* If you send an invitation to an email address for a new account, they will be prompted to create a new one.

To do this:

1. Go to `User Management` in the Client Area.
2. Enter an email address under `Invite New User`.
3. Choose `All Permissions` to grant all available permissions, or choose `Choose Permissions` and select the desired permissions.
4. Click `Send Invite`.

:::note
While invitations go to the specified email address, the recipient can complete the invitation process using this link with any email address they choose. Because of this, accepting an invitation is not equivalent to user email verification, which is a separate feature.
:::

:::caution
Customer can have restrictions on the email domain that can be invited. If you try to invite a user with an email address that is not allowed, you will receive an error message.
