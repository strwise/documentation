# Customer Management

> Work in progress

StreamWise platform requires at least one user associated with a customer to be able to access the platform. This user will be the customer's administrator and will be able to invite other users and manage the customer's resources, like accounts and rooms.

When creating a new customer, a user will be crated with the same email address as the customer's email address and the provided password. This user will be set as **owner** and will get all the privileges to manage the customer's resources.

An existing user can be associated upon customer creation prior to create a new. Please refer to [Customer Administration](/docs/administration/customers) section for more information.
